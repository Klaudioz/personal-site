# Intro

I am a co-founder and the CTO of [Arthena](https://arthena.com) where I build tools to price fine art quickly, accurately, and at scale. I also advise startups, and I invest in people and ideas through a [small venture fund](https://skepticalinvestments.biz). I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety, imaging, social impact, and aerospace. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

At Arthena, I have learned how to build teams, manage people, shape culture, develop relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [Dask](https://dask.org/), [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). I primarily work as a data engineer but have broad experience across Arthena‚Äôs stack.

# Some history

- I learned to read and write before I was three years old.

- I got a particular interest in Maths at a very little age.

- When I was 6, I saw a computer for the first time in my life, and I fell in love. I had a wealthy friend who got the classic Sinclair ZX Spectrum. Unfortunately, we moved, and I spent much time without seeing a computer again.

- Between 1989-1992, I won the local Lions Club Maths contest four times in a row.

- At 10, some friends have the Atari 800 XL where I played some games, but I never had time to program something.

- At 11, my wealthy friend got a Commodore 64, and I was invited in summer to his house. I wrote code for the first time in my life, and I was amazed that I wrote a line on an old cathode tube tv.

- At 13, I was able to have computer classes one hour/week for the first time in my life. I had access to 286 and 386 computers with a 5 1/4 drive. I learned about MS-DOS, some text editors, and very rudimentary spreadsheets. I wrote Pascal code for the first time in my life when I was 16

- At 17, I started college to study software engineering. I got almost a national score in Maths when I was 16.

- I got my first computer at that age. I was a Pentium I 133 Mhz with 16MB RAM and 1GB of HDD. My family made a tremendous effort to buy it.

- I started to sell CDs backup to have the money to buy my old computer and got the pieces to build a new one more advanced. I did it multiple times during ten years.

- I started to learn English by watching American shows like Lost. In my country, we do not have formal English education because we are surrounded only by countries speaking the same language.

- To get my college degree I build a [Lego Mindstorms robot which solves a Rubik cube with a cell phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkWLQZgi9uE)

- I wanted to learn English because more than 90% of the human knowledge is in written English, and I was losing significant opportunities to learn.

- In 2007, I started to play Holden Texas Poker online. I used a mathematical approach to play, and I finished being able to play 12-14 shorthanded tables simultaneously with scripts help. In 3 years, I converted 50 USD to 70000 USD.
  
- I came to the US to study for a master's degree, and after that, I stayed working here.
